# Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection-Framework
This project outlines a basic Cybersecurity Threat Detection Framework designed to demonstrate core concepts of log analysis and rule-based threat detection using a Python backend and a React frontend. It's a simplified example, perfect for understanding the foundational elements of how such systems operate.

## Overview

The Cybersecurity Threat Detection Framework is a comprehensive platform for detecting cyber threats using a combination of:

- Real-time log and network traffic analysis
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Rule-based signature detection
- Endpoint monitoring with osquery and Sysmon integration
- Alerting and response automation

This framework aims to empower security teams with actionable insights and reduce the time to detect and respond to cyber attacks.

## Features

- **Multi-source Data Collection:** Aggregates logs from network devices, endpoints, and cloud environments.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Includes pre-trained models for anomaly detection and classification of threats.
- **Rule-based Detection:** Supports custom YARA rules, Sigma rules, and Sysmon event filtering.
- **Visualization & Dashboard:** Integrates with Kibana for interactive data visualization and alert tracking.
- **Alerting System:** Configurable alerts via email, Slack, or webhook.
- **Extensibility:** Modular architecture allows easy addition of new detection modules and data sources.
- **Automated Threat Hunting:** Scripts and tools for proactive threat hunting and incident investigation.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install Python dependencies:


3. Configure Elasticsearch and Kibana:

- Follow official guides to install and start Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- Import provided dashboards and index patterns.

4. Start data ingestion services (e.g., Logstash):


### Usage

- Feed your logs and network data into the ingestion pipeline.
- Monitor Kibana dashboards for alerts and visualizations.
- Customize detection rules in the `/rules` directory.
- Train or update ML models using scripts in `/ml_models`.
