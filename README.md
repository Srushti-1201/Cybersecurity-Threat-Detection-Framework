Project Summary
The Cybersecurity Threat Detection Framework is an open-source, modular platform designed to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. Leveraging advanced data collection, machine learning, and rule-based detection techniques, this framework provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring network traffic, endpoint logs, and system events to identify suspicious activities and potential attacks.

The framework is built to be extensible and scalable, allowing security analysts and developers to customize detection rules, integrate new data sources, and automate alerting and response workflows. It supports integration with popular tools such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), osquery, and SIEM systems, making it suitable for enterprise environments and research projects alike.
